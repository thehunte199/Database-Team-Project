Hello! Welcome to the Contribution guidelines.

#Please comply to the forthcoming guidelines:
*Check the following boxes as you complete the required tasks*

1. You have created your own branch in which you will code.
2. Before you begin coding new features you first check that your branch has the latest commit from **master**.
  * Make sure to fix all merge conflicts between your branch and master.
3. Check _To-Do_ under **Projects** for any new requested features or bug reports.
4. When working on code move whatever feature you're working on into _In Progress_ under the **Projects** Subsection.
5. Commit **EARLY AND OFTEN** while working on your branch. Approximately every hour.
  * This is to make code changed in commits easier to read.
6. Once you are done coding you may now create a _pull-request_ on your own branch to master.
  * Pull Requests will require review by other members of the team before the will be accepted
  * James will have sole ability to merge into master
7. If you log in and your _pull-request_ still hasn't been merged click the request and check for reviews and comments. Likely there is something you need to change. 
  * **Pull Requests will have their own requirements.**
